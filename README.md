# refugees

This application was generated using JHipster, you can find documentation and help at [https://jhipster.github.io](https://jhipster.github.io).

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools (like
[Bower][] and [BrowserSync][]). You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in package.json.

    npm install

We use [Grunt][] as our build system. Install the grunt command-line tool globally with:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    mvn
    grunt

Bower is used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in `bower.json`. You can also run `bower update` and `bower install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `-h` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `bower update -h`.

# Building for production

To optimize the refugees client for production, run:

    mvn -Pprod clean package

This will concatenate and minify CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references
these new files.

To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.war --spring.profiles.active=prod

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

# Testing

Unit tests are run by [Karma][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in `src/test/javascript` and can be run with:

    grunt test



# Continuous Integration

To setup this project in Jenkins, use the following configuration:

* Project name: `refugees`
* Source Code Management
    * Git Repository: `git@github.com:xxxx/refugees.git`
    * Branches to build: `*/master`
    * Additional Behaviours: `Wipe out repository & force clone`
* Build Triggers
    * Poll SCM / Schedule: `H/5 * * * *`
* Build
    * Invoke Maven / Tasks: `-Pprod clean package`
* Post-build Actions
    * Publish JUnit test result report / Test Report XMLs: `build/test-results/*.xml`

# Heroku run
To run on heroku we have to:
 
1.  install other buildpack for java 8:

    heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-java

2.  Create file Procfile with content:

    web: java -Dserver.port=$PORT -jar target/*.war
    
   
# PostgreSQL in Docker on local env
sudo docker run --name localpostgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test123 -d postgres

# Heroku deployment
mvn -Pprod clean heroku:deploy -DskipTests

 in future, change in pom.xml line
 <web>java -Dserver.port=$PORT $JAVA_OPTS -jar target/*.war --spring.profiles.active=dev</web>
 to
 <web>java -Dserver.port=$PORT $JAVA_OPTS -jar target/*.war --spring.profiles.active=prod</web>

 I do not know, but with profile prod there is no angular frontend (maybe problems with grunt on my local machine?)
